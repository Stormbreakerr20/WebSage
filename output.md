## Frequently-asked QuestionsHere are answers to your commonly asked questions
What differentiates you from other resume review/career coaching services?
    Many other resume review services are overly generic and not targeted at Software Engineers. In fact, some of our customers have used supposedly *top resume* services before and they very much prefer our service, which is tailored towards nailing the tech job application. Moreover, how common can you get review and advice from ex-FAANG employees?
I'm not applying to a company in the Bay Area - will this still be helpful to me?
    Based on our experience, these templates and advice should be helpful for FAANG company applications regardless of region. Many applications to FAANG companies in the Bay Area come from international applicants anyway.
Why should I buy this?
    This is one of the rare few, organized resume resources from experienced ex-FAANG hiring managers. Our packages also cost less than 10% of a typical entry-level Software Engineer's monthly salary. In fact, the resume templates package costs less than or equal to a typical hourly salary. If you don't get shortlisted by your dream tech company, you are leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table.
I'm an aspiring software engineer but am starting with no knowledge of programming or Computer Science - can I still get help?
    Yes you can - and in fact you have landed at the right place. We can mentor you to become a full-fledged Software Engineer and get a job at top tech companies - regardless of your experience or profile.
